<h3>The Legislative Branch</h3>
<p>The Legislative branch of Government is the branch of Government that is responsible for the revising and approval of bills to be signed by the President. There are two houses to the Legislative Branch- The Senate and the House of Representatives. Each state has 2 Senators no matter the population, but the stateâ€™s population does determine the amount of Representatives it has. A bill,to become a law, has to pass through both houses in order to advance to the President. Each senator serves for at least 6 years, but some are elected at different times so that there are elections more often. Representatives, however, serve only 2 years, Some people from the Senate are the Vice President, Mike Pence, President of the Senate, and an example of a senator is John Cornyn. Some people from the House of representatives are the Speaker, the leader of the House, Paul Ryan, and an example of a representative is Mike Rogers.</p>
