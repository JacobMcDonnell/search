<center><h2>Checks and Balances</h2></center>
<p>Check and balances is a system used in the government to create shared powers. This allows a government to not be ruled by one power, but multiple.
Check and Balances in the U.S work in a way where there are three powers that can’t do certain things without the agreement of the other. The three branches Executive,Judicial, and Legislative have certain powers over others. This creates a system of checks and balances in the government that lets decision be made and have them checked by other branches and create a balanced government. </p>
<h3>History</h3>
<p>The framers were the first to create the system we now know as checks and balances. James Madison being known as the one to put the most effort into this idea. This system was created, because of problems seen in the past were one person can become too powerful.The most know quote was said by james Madison in the federalist papers  “If men were angels, no government would be necessary.” The same paper goes on to explain the government must control itself with the 3 branches looking lover each other.</p>

<center><h2>Supremacy Clause</h2></center>
<p>The supremacy clause was made to deal with any problems between national and local governments. The best way to put it would be “both governments could be allowed to act without mutual interference, but one government's acts could be given primacy over the other's acts in the event of actual conflict.”-Heritage guide to the Constitution. This means that if local and federal governments interfere with each other the federal government would have more of a say. </p>
<h3>History</h3>
<p>The supremacy clause is in article VI of the constitution. The supremacy clause was controversial, because it gave more power to the federal government rather the state government. James Madison and other people wanted to give the federal government the power to veto state laws. The Supremacy law was finally passed as a way to fix any controversy between two laws made on similar subjects by federal and local governments.</p>

<center><h2>Marbury Vs Madison</h2></center>
<p>Marbury Vs Madison was a case in the supreme court that was decided by John Marshall in 1803. This case started the idea that the supreme court can declare laws passed by government unconstitutional this is called judicial review. </p>
<h3>The case</h3>
<p>The case brought up to the supreme court was between William Marbury and James Madison. When Madison and the new president Thomas Jefferson were wrong to prevent Marbury from becoming justice of peace for Washington County in the District of Columbia. Even though the supreme court could not force them to allow Marbury to become justice of peace. This lead to Marbury never going to office after it was said the judges had no right to decide, because it conflicts with the constitution.</p>
