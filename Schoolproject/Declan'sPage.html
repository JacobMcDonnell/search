<p><mark><b>Article 1: </b></mark>
<b>Section 1:</b> Congress has the power to create laws, and is divided into the House of Representatives and the Senate.
<b>Section 2:</b> Representatives in the House of Representatives will be voted on every 2 years. Representatives must be 25 years old and needs to be a citizen for at least seven years. They must live in the state they were elected in. States can have different taxes and representatives, both of which are decided upon by state population. For every 30,000 people there is one representative, however, slaves count as ⅗ of a person. When a legislator is too sick to work, the governor of that state will hold an election to fill in the position. Representatives can impeach other government officials.
<b>Section 3:</b> Every state will have two senators in the US Senate. They will all meet directly after the first election. During that meeting, the senators will divide into three groups; those that leave in 2 years, those that leave in 4 years, and those that live in 6 years. If a senator is too sick to serve, then the state governor chooses another senator until the next election. Senators must be at least 30 years old and be a citizen for at least 9 years and must live in the state they were elected in. The vice president will be the president of the senate. The senate will hold an impeachment trial for any official that has been impeached by the house. If they are guilty they are removed from office and can not work fo the US ever again.
<b>Section 4:</b> The date, time, and how the election works will be decided by states when they elect their senators and representatives, but so can congress. The places that senators and representatives cannot be changed. Congress must meet at least every year.
<b>Section 5:</b> The representatives of each state will decide how many representatives will be in their state. Members of the house can be punished if they don’t show up enough for voting on bills. The house may fire a member with a ⅔ majority.
<b>Section 6:</b> Senators and representatives will be paid for their work. The money will be from the US Bank. they cannot be arrested during the meeting of congress and when they are going to or from congress.They can be arrested for murder, assault, treason, or public indecency. Nobody in congress may have a second job in the government while in office.
<b>Section 7:</b> All bills on taxes will start in the house and will then go to the senate, who will decide to pass, change, or reject them. If all of congress passes a bill, it will go to the president. If he signs it, it becomes a law. If he will send it back and give reasons why. But if both the house and the senate still pass the bill with a ⅔ majority, they override the president and the bill becomes a law.
<b>Section 8:</b> congress can tax imports to the US. Congress also controls the national budget. All taxes will be the same in the US. Congress can get loans from the US. Congress controls trade with foreign powers. Congress can make laws about getting citizenship and people in debt. Congress controls how  money is made and designed and may pass laws about counterfeit money. Congress can make laws about the postal service. Congress can make laws about patents. Congress can declare war on foreign powers and makes rules about POWs, and finances all branches of the military, and will set up the national guard. Congress can decide on where the capital of the US will be and will get 10 square miles in all directions from the neighboring state(s). Congress has the power to make laws for the US.
<b>Section 9:</b> Congress cannot control immigration to the US until 1808, but can charge ten dollars to enter the US. All people being arrested must be given a reason for their arrest, and nobody can be punished for breaking a law before the law was made. State tax will be decided by the state’s population. Congress cannot pass laws favoring any state. The senate must approve the money being made in mints, and must record how much money they spend.

<mark><br><b>Article 2 (FINALLY)</b></mark>
<b>Section 1:</b> The executive power is given to the president of the US. He will have 4 year terms. The vice president will also be chosen for a 4 year term. For the presidential election, states will choose the amount of electors they have, but the number of electors must be the same as all the state’s senators and representatives, but no congressman can be an elector. In every state, every citizen that lives there will get one vote to vote for their prefered candidate, and when a candidate wins by popular vote in a state, all the electors vote for that candidate. Once a majority of the electors have voted for one candidate, then that candidate becomes the president and the second runner will become the vice president. If there is a tie, the house will vote on the president. If they end in a tie, then the senate will decide, and if there is a tie then, the current vice president will break the tie. In order to be a president, you must be born in the US, be at least 35, and have been a US citizen for 14 years. If the president dies, then the vice president takes over. If the vice president then dies, then congress will choose someone to be president until the deceased president’s term is over. The president will be paid a fixed amount of money every year of his term and may not receive any monetary gifts from the US. When the president is sworn in he will take an oath.
<b>Section 2:</b> The president shall have power over all branches of the military. He also can pick cabinet members to advise him on what to do for things like farming, defense, health, money and trade. The president can also get people out of jail for commiting crimes, but not a former government official that broke a law and went to jail. The president can make treaties, name ambassadors, pick cabinet members, and name supreme court justices as long as congress agrees by a ⅔ vote. Congress can also assign the president to fill less important positions. The president can also fill out government positions if congress is not in session, but then must be approved by congress when they meet again.
<b>Section 3:</b> The president can tell congress about important things going on in the country so they can pass bills about those issues. When there is a very important matter to vote on, the president can tell congress to vote on it. If congress doesn’t agree then the president can dismiss congress until they agree on the issue. He can meet with ambassadors from other countries even if he doesn’t agree with them.
<b>Section 4:</b> The president, vice president, cabinet members, or other people who work for the government will be removed from office if they are found guilty in a trial involving a criminal offense.

All criminal cases will be heard by a jury in the state where the crime occured.

<b>Section 2:</b> Every citizen of every state will be treated equally. Fugitives who commited a crime in one state and left will be sent back there for trial. If slaves escape to another state, will be returned to their owner.
<b>Section 3:</b> New states will be added to congress, but no new state can be formed from an old state. No states can merge to make a new state. Congress has the final say of what happens to the land in the US.
<b>Section 4:</b> The US will allow every state to set up a state government run by the people of that state. The US government can protect the state government if the state wishes.
<mark><br><b>Article 5:</b></mark> when there is a ⅔ majority in congress or if ⅔ of the congressmen of each state recommend so, a law can be changed in the constitution if it is necessary.  When the amendment is approved by ¾ of every state’s legislature, the amendment will be added to the constitution. No state can lose their votes in the senate unless the state allows it.
<mark><br><b>Article 6:</b></mark>
<b>Section 1:</b> The constitution must be followed by everyone in the US and is the highest code of laws. All judges must make sure they follow all the constitution’s amendments and, if necessary, any state laws. All federal and state government workers must swear to support the constitution. Nobody can be kept from a government job because of their religion.

<center><h2>How A Bill Becomes A Law</h2></center>
<p>First, a bill must actually be made, either by someone from a town/city, from one of the houses of congress, or from the Executive Branch (see Executive Branch for more on the topic). Then, the bill must be introduced into the House of Representatives. If it passes, it then goes on to a committee, then it goes to Rules Committee, where it is then where the schedule is made for the debate. Then the House of Representatives debates on the bill. If passed, it moves to the Senate, where a senator presents the bill, and, if the committee majority votes for the bill, it goes to the whole Senate. After successful debate, the bill is potentially amended (basically meaning it gets altered based on the values of the Senate.) and if changes occurred, both houses make changes until they both agree. Eventually, the President, the one and only Donald Trump gets to decide on it. His decision is what makes or breaks a bill, because if he rejects it, it goes all the way back to a committee and hardly any persevere long enough to make it back to the president.</p>

<center><h2>Election Basics</h2></center>
<p>For a presidential election, every state votes on two candidates and the candidate who wins in that state by a majority wins that state. Every state has at least three electors, who will then all vote for the candidate who won their state. The number of electors in a state is the same as the number of congressmen that state. Once one candidate gets to 270(out of 538) electors they win because that is a 51% majority. However, for all Congress or state government elections are by popular vote in one state.</p>
